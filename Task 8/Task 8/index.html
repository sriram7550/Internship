    <p>The bowl was filled with fruit. It seemed to be an overabundance of strawberries,
      but it also included blueberries, raspberries, grapes, and banana slices.
      This was the meal Sarah had every morning to start her day since she could remember. </p>

    <p>Why she decided to add chocolate as an option today was still a bit of a surprise,
       but she had been in the process of deciding she wanted to change her routine.

    <p>The fog was as thick as pea soup. This was a problem. Gary was driving but couldn't see a thing in front of him. He knew he should stop, but the road was narrow so if he did, it would be right in the center of the road.
      He was sure that another car would end up rear-ending him, so he continued forward despite the lack of visibility.
      This was an unwise move.</p>
